        <h3>Hello folks! This is Emrah Isik</h3>
        <p>I am a dedicated software engineering student at THINKFUL, living in Detroit, Michigan. </p>
        <p> The areas, I am curious about: 

          <!-- unordered list created-->

          <ul>
            <li>Back End Development</li>
            <li>APIs and API Development</li>
            <li>Front End Development</li>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Coming from a mechanical engineering background, I have always enjoyed creating new products and solutions in collaboration, and solving problems. Yet, something in my mind was calling me back to where I always wanted to be: in the tech world as a software engineer. Even though I spent quite a while thinking on this career change back in my early career years, I was discouraged by some people around me. But, this time, I am highly resolute about following my dream to the end.</p>
        <p>With this manner, I took a leap by contacting Thinkful and having the prep course. Here is the last step to be officially an engineering student at Thinkful by showing off my learnt skills. Hope you like it!
